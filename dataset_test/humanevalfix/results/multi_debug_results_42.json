  "task_description": "Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\nn cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\nare driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\neach other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\nwhen a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\nHowever, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\nin their trajectory as if they did not collide.\nThis function outputs the number of such collisions.",
